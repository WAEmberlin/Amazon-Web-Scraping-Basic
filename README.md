# Amazon-Web-Scraping-Basic

I decided to experiment with using Python for web scraping since that is something I have never done before. 
I have one bigger project in mind for the future using web scraping to quickly cross-list items I have for sale between the ecommerce websites eBay and Poshmark. 
I figured this would be a great start to try and learn the basics of the Python library named Beautiful Soup which is used for web scrapping. 
With Beautiful Soup, you can take information off webpages. During this independent project, I learned there is another Python library called Selenium. 
Selenium is also used for web scraping but allows for data to be entered into forms as well. 
For the future project I want to do, I will need to use Selenium to accomplish my goal of quickly cross-listing items between ecommerce platforms. 

In this project, I scraped information off multiple Amazon item pages and exported them to a CSV file for easy viewing to include 
product name, price, the rating out of five stars, number of reviews it has, and if it was currently in stock or not. 
The purpose of this is to price track multiple items at the same time. 
It is simple to use because you just need to paste the URL for the items you are wanting to track into the text file in the folder of the program. 
Once execute, the data is exported into a CSV file. I plan to continue developing this and adding a script which would send an email every time the price changes.

Here is the process step-by-step:
Step 1. Copy URL from Amazon
Step 2. Paste URL in text file
Step 3. Run Python Script
Step 4. Open CSV file to see results
